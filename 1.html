  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">V for Vendetta</a> is a 2006 dystopian political action film
  directed by <strong>James <u>McTeigue</u></strong> and written by the Wachowskis,
   based on the 1988 DC/Vertigo Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.

  </p><p style="margin-top:45px;">V for Vendetta has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government;
   anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: "The Guy Fawkes mask has now
   become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny â€“ and I'm happy
   with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.</p>
