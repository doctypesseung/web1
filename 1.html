   anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: "The Guy Fawkes mask has now
   become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny â€“ and I'm happy
   with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.</p>
